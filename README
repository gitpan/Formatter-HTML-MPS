Formatter::HTML::MPS
====================

Formatter::HTML::MPS is a tool for writing presentations. You can
write your slides in a single file using the lightweight markup
language Markdown, adding some simple markup to identify slides and do
misc configuration.

Your file will then be converted to a single HTML file, with a default
CSS file for @media projection that will show your single file as a
set of slides.

The module comes with the command line utility mpslidemaker.pl that
uses the module to convert MPS files to HTML, and has a few options.


Format
------ 
Each slide is formatted using the Markdown format. In
addition to that, a simple format is used to set variables and to
denote new slides. 

All MPS directives start with ';'. Comments start with ';;'.

To indicate a new slide, use the 'newslide' directive. I.e., start the
line with:

  ; newslide

To set a configuration variable, use the 'set' directive. I.e.:

  ; set VAR = VALUE

Currently, supported variables are:

 * output_format: only 'xhtml1.0_strict' is supported. Example:

        ; set output_format = xhtml1.0_strict

 * title: the title of the presentation.
